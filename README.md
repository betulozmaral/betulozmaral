👋 Hello there! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🎓 I'm Betül, a senior computer engineering student with a keen interest in frontend development and UI design. I'm passionate about creating and implementing user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces that make a positive impact on people's lives.

💻 Currently, I'm honing my skills by working on school projects and taking part in coding challenges. I love experimenting with technologies like Svelte and ReactJs, and I'm excited to explore the ever-evolving world of web development.

🎨 When I'm not coding, you can find me wandering through art museums and galleries, appreciating the diverse perspectives and emotions that art evokes.

🌱 I'm constantly learning and eager to collaborate on frontend projects that challenge and inspire me.

📫 Let's connect! Feel free to reach out to me via email at bozmaral@gmail.com or connect with me on https://www.instagram.com/betulzmrl/. I'm open to discussions, project ideas, and mentoring opportunities.

🚀 My goal is to combine my computer engineering knowledge with my passion for frontend development and UI design to create innovative solutions.

Happy coding! 😊
